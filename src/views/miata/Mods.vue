        <p>
            One of the first things I did was hardwire a dashcam, a BlackVue DR770X-1CH, which,
            while mostly good, I would no longer recommend because BlackVue's app now requires a
            sign-in and is slow and buggy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wiring was ran above the windshield and through the A-pillar down to the interior
            fusebox. I used fuse taps and a breakout board to power both, and an extra fuse tap so
            the dashcam could remain recording on battery power when the engine is off.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unsure if I'd consider a BlendMount for the future as I had to position both devices
            carefully due to the already limited visibility through the tiny windshield.

            I plan to track this car in the future, but with a convertible your head (including helmet)
            must be below the top of the windshield and the roll hoops behind the seat.
            Unfortunately, I have an XL-sized head which does poke out a little bit with a helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lowering my seat took two days (I gave up on the first day, turns out working in a hot
            parking lot sucks and you'll get sunburned). I actually also had to take the seat back
            out of the car and redo the mounting of the rails as the instructions aren't updated for
            the new four-slot rail design.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately I do now fit, and hopefully I can visit a track soon.</p>

            I have a big list of parts and ideas for the future, and not enough money to make it
            happen fast enough. Here are some of the highlights (in no particular order):

                - Would be nice to have some extra power, and I don't want any turbo lag.

                - The body roll is crazy on these cars, but I think I'll wait to see how she does on
                the track before this.

                - I would love some more (louder & deeper) sound out of my car without it being
                obnoxious.
