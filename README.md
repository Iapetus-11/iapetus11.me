*My personal portfolio / general purpose website*

* Site was built in Python with a combination of aiohttp, jinja, and tailwindcss
* Currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4b cuddled up to the router
* To build the final public/styles.css from build/build.css run build.bat
* To run the site, simply run src/app.py
