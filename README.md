*My personal portfolio / general purpose website*

* Site was built in Nim, TailwindCSS, and html, and utilized the Prologue web framework library for Nim.
* Currently hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4b cuddled up to the router.
* To run the site, create a `.env` file following the example one, and run `build.sh` to build the CSS and compile the app.
